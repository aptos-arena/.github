# Aptos Arena

Aptos Arena is an arcade-style 2D platformer fighter game that uses Aptos NFT collections as characters. Each character has unique stats (speed, strength, defense) and skins. We are currently adding custom weapons, moves, animations, and sound effects.

A live build of the game is available at [this link](https://www.aptosarena.com/) and a short teaser trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxBr7vvxb1M).
